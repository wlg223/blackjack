# blackjack

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

 `npm run dev`

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.


This web app simulates a simple game of blackjack. It first starts with the player's turn and continues until the player hits the "stay" button or the card values go over 21. Then it starts the dealer's turn. When the game is finished it prompts the user to play again.
